- question:  "I am thinking about switching advisors. What is the procedure for this?"
  answer:  "First, find a faculty member that agrees to be your new advisor. When setting up meetings with potential advisors, it is in your best interest for the potential advisors to keep those meetings confidential. <strong>DO NOT</strong> tell your current advisor that you are planning on switching advisors until you have already secured a position in another group. Then, tell the co-director at your school that you are planning on switching advisors. If your current advisor is one of the co-directors, talk to either the assistant director at your school or the other co-director. They will help facilitate the switching process from there."
